# Chilling-Cafe
Recreated a landing page by Tooplate, using only HTML5 and CSS3

In this project, I did a mobile-first approach which allowed me to see how efficient it is to start this way as oppose to desktop-first.
I also learned about tables and how to style them. Likewise, had some more practice with css grid which was awesome!

Overall, fun project for sure!
